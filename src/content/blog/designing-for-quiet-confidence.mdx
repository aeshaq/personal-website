It is a rite of passage for software engineers to make a personal website. I attempted to do it the first time back in my first year of CS 
in university and it seemed too big of a challenge, and then I forgot about it, became too busy with school, other projects and internships
and finally with my full time job. 

Coming back to it now, with a little more experience under my belt, building the site was easy and enjoyable. It makes me think of how experience
is built in small steps. I don't remember waking up one day and thinking coding something I struggled with before was all of a suddent easy, it happened 
over time, slowly.
